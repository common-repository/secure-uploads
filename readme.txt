== Description ==

This is a simple plugin to protect your wp-content/uploads folder from being browsed and people downloading your content
(Based on the plugin “Secure Folder wp-content/uploads” made by Daniel Satria)

== Installation ==

2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to Settings > Secure Uploads.
4. Click on "Secure uploads now!" button to start the process.

Yes, the plugin will put the index.php in every sub-directory wp-content/uploads but it only does it when you click the "Secure uploads now!" button to start the process.
